### 📘 **Train/Validation/Test Splits – Detailed Explanation**

Proper data splitting is **critical for unbiased model performance evaluation** and avoiding overfitting. Here's a comprehensive breakdown:

---

## **1. Why Split the Data?**

The goal is to **simulate how the model will perform on unseen data** and tune it effectively without leaking information from test sets.

## **2. Standard Splitting Strategy**

| Split Type         | Purpose                                                 | Typical Size (%) |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Training Set**   | Used to **fit/train** the model's parameters.           | 60–80%           |
| **Validation Set** | Used to **tune hyperparameters** and compare models.    | 10–20%           |
| **Test Set**       | Used only at the end to **evaluate final performance**. | 10–20%           |

## **3. Key Concepts**

### ✅ **Training Set**

* Input to the model during the learning phase.
* The model “sees” this data and updates internal weights/coefficients accordingly.

### 🧪 **Validation Set**

* Acts like a **"mini test set"** during training.
* Used to:

  * Tune hyperparameters (e.g., tree depth, learning rate).
  * Perform model selection (comparing different algorithms).
* Must not be used for final performance claims.

### 📊 **Test Set**

* **Held back entirely** until the very end.
* Only used once to simulate how the model performs in the real world.
* Final metric used for reporting accuracy, RMSE, AUC, etc.

## **4. Common Practices**

### 🔁 **When Data Is Limited**:

Use **Cross-Validation** instead of a static validation set to better estimate model generalization.

### 🧼 **Ensure Stratification (for Classification)**:

Preserve class distribution across splits using **stratified sampling**, especially if classes are imbalanced.

---

## **5. Mistakes to Avoid**

* ❌ **Using test set for tuning** – causes **data leakage** and **overestimation** of performance.
* ❌ **Not stratifying** when class imbalance exists – leads to skewed evaluation.
