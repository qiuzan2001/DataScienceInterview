Below is a ‚Äúzoom-in‚Äù on **ID3‚Äôs heart‚Äîthe split-selection loop‚Äîand why each mathematical piece matters.**
I keep the math at an undergraduate comfort level but fill in every logical gap, so you can re-derive the algorithm on a blank sheet of paper.

---

## 1‚ÄÉWhy do we need a quantitative ‚Äúgoodness of split‚Äù measure?

Imagine you stand at one node with $k$ different candidate questions (attributes).
You want the one that makes the child nodes **as pure as possible**‚Äîbecause the purer the children, the **fewer additional questions** you will need down each branch.

So we need:

1. ‚ô¶ **A scale for purity/impurity** (‚Üí *entropy*).
2. ‚ô¶ **A rule that converts impurity to a single score for each candidate** (‚Üí *information gain*).
3. ‚ô¶ **A way to update the training set and recurse**.

Everything in ID3‚Äôs core loop is just those three bullets formalised.

## 2‚ÄÉEntropy revisited‚Äîthree intuitive viewpoints

### 2.1‚ÄÉCoding length viewpoint

Suppose you must transmit the class label of a random example over a binary channel.
The **minimum expected number of bits** any coding scheme can achieve is Shannon entropy:

$$
H(S)=\!\!\sum_{c=1}^{C}p(c)\log_2\!\bigl(\tfrac1{p(c)}\bigr).
$$

* When all examples are one class: $p=1$ ‚áí $H=0$ bits (no uncertainty).
* When classes are equally likely: $H$ is largest ‚áí code needs most bits.
>[!Example ]-   üß† Deeper Explanation
>  Entropy originally comes from *information theory* (by Claude Shannon, 1948). Imagine you're sending data (like class labels) over a wire ‚Äî you want to do it in the fewest bits possible.
>  
>  Let‚Äôs say you want to send the class label of one sample. If there are 3 classes, and:
>  
>  * Class A appears 50% of the time,
>  * Class B appears 25% of the time,
>  * Class C appears 25% of the time,
>  
>  A good strategy would be to **assign shorter binary codes to common classes**, and longer ones to rare ones (Huffman coding). For example:
>  
>  * A ‚Üí `0`
>  * B ‚Üí `10`
>  * C ‚Üí `11`
>  
>  That way, over many transmissions, your *average bits per message* goes down.

>  
>  * **Entropy = how ‚Äúcostly‚Äù it is to transmit the class label**.

>  
>  #### üîÅ Decision Tree Analogy:
>  
>  * Every decision (test) in a tree is like *revealing some bits* about the label.
>  * The goal is to choose attributes (splits) that **most reduce the number of bits** needed to "guess" the class.
>  
>  So when ID3 chooses a split with high *information gain*, it‚Äôs picking the one that would reduce your total communication cost the most.

### 2.2‚ÄÉQuestion-and-answer game viewpoint

You play ‚ÄúGuess the class‚Äù where each yes/no question costs one ‚Äúbit.‚Äù
Entropy is the **best-case average number of questions** you still need.

>[!Example]- Example - ‚ÄúGuess the Animal in the Box‚Äù

>  
>  Your only tool is to ask **yes/no questions** such as:
>  
>  * ‚ÄúDoes it bark?‚Äù
>  * ‚ÄúIs it a mammal that commonly lives indoors?‚Äù
>  * ‚ÄúDoes it weigh more than 5 kg?‚Äù
>  
>  Each answer costs **one bit** (one question).
>  What is the *least* average number of bits you‚Äôll need if you design the questions perfectly?

### 2.3‚ÄÉProbability of error viewpoint

For 2 classes, $H(p)$ is a monotone transform of $p(1-p)$ (the variance of a Bernoulli trial).
Both peak at $p=0.5$. So minimising entropy pushes you toward leaves with low misclassification risk.

> [!Example]- üß† Deeper Explanation
>   
>   Suppose you reach a node in the decision tree where:
>   
>   * 90% of examples are class A,
>   * 10% are class B.
>   
>   You haven‚Äôt split further ‚Äî you‚Äôll assign the **majority class**, class A, as the prediction for this leaf.
>   
>   The chance that you misclassify a new sample here is just:
>   
>   $$
>   \text{Error} = 1 - p_{\text{majority}} = 0.1
>   $$
>   
>   This is a **misclassification rate**.
>   
>   Now think about what entropy says:
>   
>   $$
>   H(p) = -p \log_2 p - (1-p) \log_2(1-p)
>   $$
>   
>   * For $p = 0.9$, $H ‚âà 0.47$
>   * For $p = 0.5$, $H = 1$
>   * For $p = 1$, $H = 0$
>   
>   So entropy is lowest when you're sure (p = 0 or 1), and highest when you‚Äôre completely unsure (p = 0.5). This directly matches **error likelihood** and **variance**.
>   
>   ---
>   
>   #### üìä Why mention variance $p(1-p)$?
>   
>   Because it‚Äôs a **simpler impurity metric** often used in decision trees (like CART uses it instead of entropy). Like entropy:
>   
>   * Variance is 0 at $p = 0$ and $p = 1$,
>   * Maximum at $p = 0.5$
>   
>   So minimizing either reduces the chance of class confusion.
>   
>   ---
>   
>   #### ‚úÖ Key Takeaways:
>   
>   * **Entropy closely tracks the expected classification error at a node**.
>   * When you split and reduce entropy, you‚Äôre also **reducing the expected misclassification rate**.
>   * This makes entropy not just a mathematical concept but a directly practical one.


## 3‚ÄÉFrom entropy to Information Gain

### 3.1‚ÄÉWeighted-average impurity

If you split on attribute $A$ with values $v_1,\dots,v_r$, you partition $S$ into $S_{v_1},\dots,S_{v_r}$.
The **expected post-split impurity** is

$$
\overline{H}(S,A)=\sum_{i=1}^{r}\frac{|S_{v_i}|}{|S|}\,H(S_{v_i})
$$

which is just the entropy you would expect to pay **after** you ask the question.

### 3.2‚ÄÉDefinition & units

$$
\operatorname{Gain}(S,A)=H(S)-\overline{H}(S,A)\quad\text{(measured in *bits*).}
$$

Because the second term is never larger than the first,

* **Gain ‚â• 0**, and
* it is exactly the **expected number of bits you save** by knowing the answer to $A$.

Hence the greedy rule: **pick the attribute with the largest positive saving**.

## 4‚ÄÉPractical algorithmic loop (pseudo-code)

```text
function ID3(S, Attributes):
    if all examples in S share class c: return Leaf(c)
    if Attributes is empty: return Leaf(MajorityClass(S))

    bestA ‚Üê argmax_{A‚ààAttributes} Gain(S, A)
    node ‚Üê DecisionNode(bestA)

    for each value v of bestA:
        Sv ‚Üê {examples in S with bestA = v}
        if Sv is empty:
            node.addBranch(v, Leaf(MajorityClass(S)))      # missing-value path
        else:
            node.addBranch(v, ID3(Sv, Attributes \ {bestA}))
    return node

### 4.1‚ÄÉKey ‚Äúgotchas‚Äù in the loop

| Detail                                                 | Why it exists                                                                | What happens if you omit it                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Drop bestA** from the attribute set when you recurse | Prevents infinite loops & makes each path a *conjunction* of distinct tests. | You might ask the same question again lower down ‚áí pointless work, possible cycles. |
| **Empty-subset check**                                 | Some attribute values might never occur in training data.                    | Without a default leaf you would create an empty node with no class label.          |
| **Stopping at majority class when Attributes=‚àÖ**       | You ran out of questions but still have mixed classes.                       | Keeps the tree finite and always returns a class.                                   |

---

## 5‚ÄÉTie-breaking and secondary criteria

Occasionally two attributes share identical gain. Good practice is:

1. **Prefer the one with fewer values** (simpler test ‚Üí less risk of overfit).
2. If still tied, pick the first alphabetically or by column order (determinism).

---

## 6‚ÄÉHandling continuous features inside the same loop

ID3 was born for categorical data, but the logic extends with a slight tweak:

1. **Sort** the values of attribute $A$.
2. **Try every boundary** midway between consecutive class changes, e.g. thresholds $\tau$.
3. Compute information gain for each binary split ‚Äú$A ‚â§ œÑ$ ?‚Äù
4. Keep the œÑ that gives maximum gain; treat that as a two-value attribute.

The core loop (entropy ‚Üí gain ‚Üí best split ‚Üí recurse) stays untouched.

---

## 7‚ÄÉWhy greedy?‚Äîan optimal-substructure argument

* **Goal**: minimise the *expected* number of bits (questions) to reach purity.
* **Entropy is additive**: total bits = bits for root question + bits for the subtree reached.
* Therefore, **to minimise the sum, you must minimise the root term first**, irrespective of what the sub-trees will do.
* After committing to the root, the problem **decomposes** into independent sub-problems on $S_v$.

This is an instance of the *optimal-substructure property*‚Äîthe same principle behind algorithms like Huffman coding or Dijkstra. Hence greedy choice is justified.

Nota bene: the property fails if your impurity metric were non-additive; then gain would not align with global optimality.

---

## 8‚ÄÉComplexity analysis grounded in the loop

Let $n$ total examples, $m$ attributes, $k$ average #values per attribute.

* **Entropy of parent set**: compute class counts once ‚Üí $O(n)$.
* **For each attribute**: need class counts per value. A single pass through $S$ filling a 2-D table is $O(nm)$.
  *Memory tip*: reuse counts across attributes in one pass by storing them in a list of hash tables.
* **Choose max gain**: $O(mk)$ (usually trivial next to $nm$).

So *per level* work is $O(nm)$.
If the tree depth is $d$ and splits roughly halve $n$ each time, total is $O(nm d) ‚âà O(nm \log n)$.

---

## [[7.2.2.3.1.9 ID3 Build Example| 9‚ÄÉProof-of-concept numerical example]]

Consider a binary class dataset with $10$ positives and $6$ negatives at a node:

$$
H(S)= -\tfrac{10}{16}\log_2\tfrac{10}{16} - \tfrac{6}{16}\log_2\tfrac{6}{16}=0.954\text{ bits.}
$$

Attribute $A$ has three values producing child class distributions:

| Value | Pos | Neg | Child Entropy |
| ----- | --- | --- | ------------- |
| v‚ÇÅ    | 4   | 0   | 0             |
| v‚ÇÇ    | 4   | 4   | 1.000         |
| v‚ÇÉ    | 2   | 2   | 1.000         |

$$
\overline{H}(S,A)=\frac4{16}\cdot0 + \frac8{16}\cdot1 + \frac4{16}\cdot1 = 0.75
$$

$$
\operatorname{Gain}(S,A)=0.954-0.75 = 0.204\text{ bits.}
$$

If a different attribute $B$ yields $\overline{H}=0.60$, then
$\operatorname{Gain}(S,B)=0.354$ bits ‚áí choose $B$.
The *decimal* bits may look small, but a $0.15$-bit difference over thousands of splits can cascade into a drastically shallower tree.

---

## 10‚ÄÉConnecting back to other impurity criteria

Entropy is not sacred; what matters in the loop is **monotonic impurity reduction**.

| Criterion                   | Formula                    | Same loop tweaks?                                               |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Gini**                    | $G(S)=\sum_c p(c)(1-p(c))$ | Replace entropy with Gini; rest identical.                      |
| **Misclassification error** | $1-\max_c p(c)$            | Works but is less sensitive; produces poorer trees in practice. |

Any impurity metric that is **zero at purity and concave in $p$** will respect the optimal-substructure argument, so the greedy logic holds.

---

### Key mental model to retain

```
ENTROPY = how many ‚Äú20-questions‚Äù still needed
GAIN    = how many questions you save by asking attribute A next
GREEDY  = keep asking the question that chops off the most uncertainty right now
```

Hold this triad and you can re-invent ID3, C4.5, CART, or even devise your own split criteria.

## 11‚ÄÉWhere ID3 Hits a Wall‚Äîand How **[[7.2.3.3 C4.5 Algorithm| C4.5]]** Climbs Over It

Even with the elegant ‚Äúentropy ‚Üí gain ‚Üí recurse‚Äù loop, real-world data exposes four weak spots in ID3. Quinlan‚Äôs next algorithm‚Äî**C4.5**‚Äîkeeps the skeleton but inserts clever work-arounds for each. Understanding these limits is the smoothest runway into C4.5.

| Limitation in vanilla ID3                                                                                                                                                         | Why it matters in practice                                                                    | C4.5‚Äôs fix (preview)                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1. Bias toward many-valued attributes**<br>Information Gain grows with the number of distinct values, so ‚ÄúZIP Code‚Äù can outrank a truly predictive but low-cardinality feature. | Splits can look great on training data yet be useless for novel examples (overfit).           | **Gain Ratio** rescales the gain by the attribute‚Äôs own entropy, penalising needlessly fine partitions.                                                      |
| **2. No pruning‚Äîtrees can explode**<br>ID3 expands until leaves are pure or attributes run out. Noise or outliers then spawn deep, single-example branches.                       | Large trees are hard to interpret and generalise poorly.                                      | **Post-pruning** (subtree replacement/error-based) snips statistically weak branches, trading a tiny bias for big variance reduction.                        |
| **3. Crude treatment of continuous features**<br>We manually tried ‚Äúevery boundary‚Äù (¬ß6) once per numeric attribute per node.                                                     | Re-sorting at every node is $O(n\log n)$; plus, fixed thresholds can still overfit.           | C4.5 **sorts once**, carries running class counts to evaluate all thresholds in a single linear scan‚Äîfast *and* less fragile.                                |
| **4. All-or-nothing handling of missing values**<br>Standard ID3 either discards rows or fills with modes/means before training.                                                  | Both strategies inject bias: discarding wastes data, global imputation ignores local context. | C4.5 uses **fractional instance weighting**: an example with $A=\text{?}$ is split fractionally down every branch of $A$ according to learned probabilities. |
