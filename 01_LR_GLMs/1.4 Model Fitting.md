## ‚ùì Why Can‚Äôt GLMs Use Least Squares Estimation?

### üîë Short Answer:

Because **GLMs are designed for outcome variables that do not have normally distributed, constant-variance errors**, and **LSE only works well when those specific assumptions hold**.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Long Answer: Understanding the Mismatch

#### 1. **LSE assumes normally distributed residuals with constant variance**

Least Squares Estimation (LSE) minimizes the squared differences between actual and predicted values:

$$
\text{Loss} = \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
$$

This only gives **Best Linear Unbiased Estimators (BLUE)** *if*:

* Errors are **normally distributed**
* Errors have **constant variance (homoscedasticity)**
* The outcome is **continuous**

üëâ But GLMs are designed for **non-normal distributions**, like:

* **Binomial** (e.g., logistic regression)
* **Poisson** (for count data)
* **Gamma** (for skewed continuous data)

So minimizing squared error doesn‚Äôt make sense statistically or mathematically under these distributions.

#### 2. **GLMs model the mean of Y via a link function and assume different distributions**

GLMs don‚Äôt directly model the raw difference between $y$ and $\hat{y}$; instead, they model:

$$
g(\mathbb{E}[Y]) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \dots + \beta_p X_p
$$

Where:

* $g$ = link function (e.g., logit for binary, log for counts)
* $\mathbb{E}[Y]$ = expected value of the outcome under a **non-normal distribution**

‚û°Ô∏è Squared error **doesn‚Äôt align with** these transformed scales or non-Gaussian likelihoods.

---

#### 3. **MLE is more general and better suited for exponential family distributions**

GLMs are built on the **exponential family** of distributions. For these, **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)** is the mathematically appropriate method because:

* It uses the **actual probability distribution** of the outcome.
* It produces **consistent, efficient, and asymptotically normal estimators** under general conditions.

### üö´ Example: Logistic Regression

Imagine trying to fit logistic regression using LSE. The squared error loss would look like:

$$
\sum (y_i - p_i)^2, \quad \text{where } p_i = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-X_i^\top \beta}}
$$

This:

* Violates assumptions of constant variance (binary data has variance $p(1 - p)$)
* Penalizes errors inappropriately (squared error loss is symmetric, but classification loss is not)
* Leads to **inefficient and biased estimates** compared to MLE

### ‚úÖ Final Takeaway:

GLMs use MLE because they **adapt to the actual distribution** of the outcome variable and use a **link function**, which makes squared error loss unsuitable. LSE is powerful but only for **normally distributed, homoscedastic, continuous outcomes**‚Äîwhich is what OLS assumes.
